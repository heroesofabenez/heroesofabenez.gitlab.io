Heroes of Abenez
================

About
-----

The project Heroes of Abenez was started in 2013 by Jakub Konečný. The ultimate goal is to create online (browser-based) fantasy game. It is in early alpha stage.

Some parts that can be reused by other projects were separated from main repository into standalone packages which can be downloaded via Composer.

Repositories
------------

Almost all of the project's repositories are hosted on both [GitHub](https://github.com/heroesofabenez) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/heroesofabenez/). All development takes place on GitLab (where issues and pull/merge should be created). The repositories on GitHub are just mirrors.

Used stuff
----------

Our primary programming language is PHP. We use version 7.2, our code is ready for 7.3. Our projects are powered by [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/en/). We heavily test our code with Nette Tester (improved by testbench by Martin Zlámal). We also run codesniffer, parallel lint and phpstan on our codebase in CI to ensure its quality.
